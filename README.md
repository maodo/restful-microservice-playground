# restful-microservice-playground
My playground for trying out frameworks and technologies related to modern java-based web applications. It revolves around:

- RESTful Web-Service using JAX-RS and Swagger
- Microservices with Dropwizard
- MongoDB
- Single Page Applications with AngularJS
- Yeoman, Bower, Grunt
